- 👋 Hi, I’m zahid

- 👀  My workspace is Application Developer, working with
-   paradigms , frameworks & Application Generators. 
- 🌱 Current interest is REACT.
-  React is all about composition 
-  software development is, in essence, the process of breaking a problem down into
-  smaller problems, implementing solutions for those smaller problems, and then
-  composing those solutions to form partial solutions, and so on, until eventually
-  completing the whole solution.
-  This Github is a collection of React components which I can use as reference to 
-  implement frontend solutions on any project and a few samples frameworks
-  also of interest, ROS (Robot Operaing System) , Microprofile (Java
-   microservices). Further details of my skills & aspirations can be found at
-    www.backbutton.org 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  e-commerce projects
