- 👋 Hi, I’m zahid
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack technologies comprising microprofile , Reactjs, RDBMS Postgres.
      My approach is to first find the architecture before learning to code it.
      The Ideal architecture must be simple , flexible and opensource (free professional product documentation).
      Examples of simple are, US DOD (Department of Defence) adopting Ada,
      the ability to break down complex business domain so that it can fit inside the head of an average
      developer to help with software maintenance.
      Flexible enough to deal with real world e-commerce English challenges i.e Response timing.
      I learned these concepts from my observations whilst working in British Software development companies for five years.      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  Microprofile on openliberty Reactjs , RDBMS Postgres
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  e-commerce projects
