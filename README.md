- 👋 Hi, I’m zahid
- 👀 I’m interested in microservices,full stack technologies comprising microprofile , Reactjs, RDBMS Postgres.
      My approach is first find the architecture before learning to code it.
      The Ideal architecture must be both simple and flexible. 
      By simple I mean the reasons US DOD (Department of Defence) adopted Ada.
      Flexible enough to deal with real world e-commerce Business challenges i.e Responsive timing.       
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  Microprofile on openliberty Reactjs , RDBMS Postgres
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  e-commerce projects
