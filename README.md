- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m zahid
- ðŸ‘€ My workspace is Application Development, its existence is found in paradigms, frameworks & Application Generators to achieve Rapid Application Development. 
-  www.backbutton.org 
- ðŸŒ± This Repository is a collection of REACT components for use on projects.

- Components break down the UI into smaller independent components. Components are composed with other components to create greater components, and so on until they eventually complete the whole UI.

- Software development is, in essence, the process of breaking a problem down into smaller problems, implementing solutions for those smaller problems, and then composing those solutions to form partial solutions, and so on, until eventually completing the whole solution.
-  Other application generators of interests are Java Microprofile,ROS (Robot Operating System).
