- 👋 Hi, I’m zahid
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack technologies comprising microprofile [Business Logic], Reactjs [GUI], RDBMS Postgres [Datastore].
      My approach to gaining useful skills is to first find the ideal architecture before learning to code it.
      The Ideal architecture must be simple, flexible and opensource (free professional product documentation).
      A definition of simple is, US DOD (Department of Defence)'s decision to adopt one programming language, Ada.
      The ability to break down complex business domain.
      Flexible enough to deal with real world e-commerce consumer demands i.e Response timing.
      I adopted these concepts whilst working in English Software development companies for five years.
      Five years was ample for me to see there are three sides to Software development.
      The good, the bad and the ugly and the need to become a self learner.
