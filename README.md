- 👋 Hi, I’m zahid
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack technologies comprising microprofile [Business Logic], Reactjs [GUI], RDBMS Postgres [Datastore].
      My approach to gaining useful skills is to first find the ideal architecture before learning to code it.
      The Ideal architecture must be simple, flexible and opensource (free professional product documentation).
      A definition of simple is, US DOD (Department of Defence)'s decision to adopt one programming language, Ada.
      The ability to break down complex business domain.
      Flexible enough to deal with real world e-commerce consumer demands i.e Response timing.
      I adopted these concepts whilst working in English Software development companies for five years.
      Nature of these companies varied from realtime Aerospace,Customer Billing system,Software house.  
      Five years were ample for me to gain the required understanding for building Industrial strength Applications.
      Hence I look for the right architecture first then teach myself to code using freely available
      professional product documentation,may be invest in a book or two on the desired architecture.
