- 👋 Hi, I’m zahid
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack technologies comprising microprofile [Business Logic], Reactjs [GUI], RDBMS Postgres [Datastore].
      My approach is to first find the architecture which supports certain concepts, before learning to code it.
      The Ideal architecture must be simple, flexible and opensource (free professional product documentation).
      A definition of simple is, US DOD (Department of Defence)'s decision to adopt one programming language, Ada.
      The ability to break down complex business domain so that it is not beyond the human intellect or intellect of the developer.
      Use APIs that are likely to be familiar to the Application developer/maintainer.
      Flexible enough to deal with real world e-commerce challenges i.e Response timing.
      I adopted these concepts whilst working in English Software development companies for five years.
