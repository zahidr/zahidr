- 👋 Hi, I’m zahid

- 👀 I’m interested in full stack technologies comprising microprofile [Business Logic,DB Access], Reactjs [GUI,LOGIN], RDBMS Postgres [Database].
      The Ideal architecture must be simple, flexible and opensource [free access to professional product documentation].
      An example of simple is, US DOD (Department of Defence)'s decision to adopt one programming language, Ada.
      The architecture must be flexible enough to allow for break down of Complex business domain.
      Responsive to end user demands, institution of failure & recovery for loosely coupled components.
      I adopted these concepts whilst working in English Software development companies for five years.
      Nature of these companies varied from realtime Aerospace,Customer Billing system,Software house.  
      Five years were ample for me to gain the required due diligence skills needed for building Industrial strength Applications.
      Hence I look for the right architecture first then teach myself to code that architecture using freely available
      professional product documentation, may be even invest in a book or two on the selected architecture.

- 🌱 The Collections Apps found at this Github account are exercises in prototyping.
      The purpose of protoyping is to test application threads,      
      and of course when testing one is likely to find software BUGS i.e.
